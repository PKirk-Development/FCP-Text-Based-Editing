  Hardened Runtime entitlements for FCP Text-Based Editor.

  These two exceptions are required for all PyInstaller-built Python apps
  because Python relies on unsigned executable memory (JIT / ctypes) and
  loads third-party native extensions (.so / .dylib) at runtime.

  Without these, notarization will succeed but Gatekeeper will kill the
  app at launch when the hardened runtime flags the Python interpreter.
